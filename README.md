# ArduinoProjekt
This is a projekt that is supposed to be able to detect sound using a sound sensor and an arduino

## Main components

* Arduino UNO
* Soundsensor
* Relay
* Ledlamp

## How it works
The Soundsensor takes in sound and stores it as a value, i then set a limit to that value. If the value goes above that limit a function will activate and start a process that then turns on a ledlamp.

## Software

* Platform.io
    * Makes the program run the code on the arduino
